# Phonebook-App
<ul>
<li>A simple phonebook app made using Ionic + React.</li>
<li>This app communicate with a Node server through HTTP requests (for that I used Axios).</li>
<li>You can store and update your contacts by completing their name and number (those fields are mandatory). Optionally, you are able to mark your contacts as favourites, pin them on map and set a picture using your camera/gallery.</li>
<li>If you are logged in but connection to internet fails, you are able to save items locally and continue your activity.</li>
<li>This application is filled with small animations in order to inform you (e. g. if connection to internet suddenly interrupts, a little animation is played on a label that tells you your current network status).</li>
<strong>Note:</strong> This is an application developed in an entire semester for one of my classes: <i>Programming on mobile devices</i>. The purpose of this was to learn by actually doing.
